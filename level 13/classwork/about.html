    <h1><b>About these films</b></h1>
    <h2>Interstellar</h2>
    <p>Directed by <i>Christopher Nolan</i> (great director), this sci-fi drama explores love, time, and space travel.
        Famous actors - <i>Matthew McConaughey</i> and <i>Anne Hathaway</i> play astronauts on a mission to save
        humanity.
    </p>

    <h2><b>Saw</b></h2>
    <p>A psychological, detective horror film directed by <i>James Wan</i>. It features the terrifying Jigsaw killer,
        who puts
        people
        through deadly games to make them value life. Known for its twists and dark themes. For me, its not just torture
        and massacre, its twists are mind-blowing.</p>

    <h2><b>Dead Poets Society</b></h2>
    <p>A beautiful drama directed by <i>Peter Weir</i>. <i>Robin Williams</i> plays an English teacher who inspires
        students to "seize
        the day" through poetry, freedom, and expression. It's very deep, i think about this regularly.</p>
